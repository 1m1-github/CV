* Coded basic ZKP circuits.

MATH
* Graduated as the top of my year at the top university in the country in pure math.
* Independently wrote a proof for the sparsity and uncountability of the Cantor set, in my 1st semester.

* Took and passed math classes at the local university during highschool.

ECONOMICS/FINANCE
* Found and coded the best portfolio optimization algorithm, underlying strategies running ~10^10 USD to date, presented at MIT, using financial math, CUDA, Matlab, Java, Julia.
* Created a language to express arbitrary financial products to be evaluated using arbitrary diffusion Monte Carlo simulations, still used at one of the largest investment banks, using C++, VBA.
* 3x coded entirely automated hedge funds from scratch on my own including every aspect like strategy running, portfolio optimization, trade execution and reconciliation, analysis, using different broker APIs, including FIX, IB, FIX, IB, WebOE and ZeroMQ, C#, Matlab, Java, Julia.
* Published an arbitrary currency fair ordering algorithm.
* Received certifications such as Series 3, FRM, Eurex Trader.
* Coded an algorithm for company internal soccer sports betting competitions, placing 4x top-5 including 2x 1st, using information theory, dynamic programming.
* Received 14x top-10 BarclayHedge awards for own trading system (incl. 1st).
* Worked as a quant for the elite team for a top-10 bank and received a record time promotion.

LEADERSHIP
* Head of Research, Trading and IT for a hedge fund automating the entire business from scratch.
* CIO (investment) for multi PM hedge fund.
* CRO and CTO for delivering highly cost efficient and fully automated AI based retail credit.

GRAPHICS

* Coded various fractals and other dynamic, mathematical art usable as screensavers, using math, C, Julia, Pascal.
* Coded some small games rendering efficiently stored artwork, using Pascal, C++.
* Coded an AR fashion app which recognizes the human shape and overlays dynamic graphics on top, using Javascript.

BACKEND CODING
* Coded lots of systems using the best tech considering the problem with high memory and speed efficiency, using C, C++, C#, Java, Julia, Golang, PHP, Perl.
* Conceptualized and coded a data schema for a system allowing users to run code in various languages from a spreadsheet, using ProtoBuf, C#.

FRONTEND CODING
* Built and replaced a fully functional client portal for a large firm in 2 weeks as their existing system needed daily restarts and was full of issues, using .NET, C#.
* Coded a simple webapp to display lists given user provided data and css, yet staying safe, using Javascript.
